The Tortuosity plugin for ImageJ computes the tortuosity of a 2D or 3D pore (or grain) network based on the geodesic reconstruction algorithm. To install the plugin just download the Tortuosity.zip file and unzip it inside the pluginÂ´s directory of ImageJ. Once it is there, when ImageJ is loaded, the Tortuosity plugin will appears in the tab of Plugins. 
Details about the Tortuosity plugin can be read in the paper "A plugin for computing the pore/grain network tortuosity of a porous medium from 2D/3D MicroCT image", Waldir L. Roque and Richelieu R.A. Costa, Applied Computing and Geosciences 5 (2020) 100019, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acags.2020.100019.
